Some make small mistakes, we prefer HUGE mistakes. No "wrongs" or "rights." NEVER judgemental. Get in, get dirty, and hopefully you're in for the long run. Either way you've tried, openness is what we strive for; "for the people,by the people" cause without all these contributions, we'd be one boring lifeform, non-symbiotic.  It's a whole lot more interesting grunting and moaning together. Tied up into one BIG knot of opinions, we all create something, well, right or wrong is subjective, and those two words shouldn't exist; si we just say, if it makes you smile, then...,..ðŸ˜‰
